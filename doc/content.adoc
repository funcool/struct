== Introduction

A structural validation library for Clojure and ClojureScript.

Highlights:

- *No macros*: validators are defined using plain data.
- *Dependent validators*: the ability to access to already validated data.
- *Coercion*: the ability to coerce incoming values to other types.
- *No exceptions*: no exceptions used in the validation process.

=== Project Maturity

Since _struct_ is a young project there may be some API breakage.


=== Install

Just include that in your dependency vector on *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/struct "1.1.0"]
----


== User guide

=== Quick Start

Let's require the main _struct_ namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[struct.core :as st])
----

Define a small schema for the example purpose:

[source, clojure]
----
(def +scheme+
  {:name [st/required st/string]
   :year [st/required st/number]})
----

You can observe that it consists in a simple map when you declare keys and
corresponding validators for that key. A vector as value allows us to put
more than one validator for the same key. If you have only one validator for the
key, you can omit the vector and put it as single value.

The same schema can be defined using vectors, if the order of validation
matters:

[source, clojure]
----
(def +scheme+
  [[:name st/required st/string]
   [:year st/required st/number]])
----

By default, all validators are optional so if the value is missing, no error
will reported. If you want make the value mandatory, you should use a specific
`required` validator.

And finally, start validating your data:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [nil {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994}]

(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year "1994"}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [{:year "must be a number"} {:name "Blood of Elves", :year "1994"}]

(-> {:year "1994"}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [{:name "this field is mandatory", :year "must be a number"} {}]
----

If only want to know if some data is valid or not, you can use the `valid?` predicate
for that purpose:

[source, clojure]
----
(st/valid? {:year "1994"} +scheme+)
;; => false
----

The additional entries in the map are not stripped by default, but this behavior
can be changed passing an additional flag as the third argument:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994 :foo "bar"}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [nil {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994 :foo "bar"}]

(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994 :foo "bar"}
    (st/validate +scheme+ {:strip true}))
;; => [nil {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994}]

----

With similar syntax you can validate neested data structures, specifying in the
key part the proper path to the neested data structure:

[source, clojure]
----
(def +scheme+
  {[:a :b] st/integer
   [:c :d] st/string})

(-> {:a {:b "foo"} {:c {:d "bar"}}}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [{:a {:b "must be a number"}} {:c {:d "bar"}}]
----


=== Parametrized validators

In addition to simple validators, one may use additional contraints
(e.g. `in-range`). This is how they can be passed to the validator:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema {:num [[st/in-range 10 20]]})

(st/validate {:num 21} schema)
;; => [{:num "not in range"} {}]

(st/validate {:num 19} schema)
;; => [nil {:num 19}]
----

Note the double vector; the outer denotes a list of validatiors and the inner
denotes a validator with patameters.


=== Custom messages

The builtin validators comes with default messages in human readable format, but
sometimes you may want to change them (e.g. for i18n purposes). This is how you
can do it:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema
  {:num [[st/in-range 10 20 :message "errors.not-in-range"]]})

(st/validate {:num 21} schema)
;; => [{:num "errors.not-in-range"} {}]
----

A message can contains format wildcards `%s`, these wildcards will be replaced by `args` of validator, e.g.:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema
  {:age [[st/in-range 18 26 :message "The age must be between %s and %s"]]})

(st/validate {:age 30} schema)
;; => [{:age "The age must be between 18 and 26"} {}]

----


=== Data coercions

In addition to simple validations, this library includes the ability
to coerce values, and a collection of validators that matches over strings. Let's
see some code:

.Example attaching custom coercions
[source, clojure]
----
(def schema
  {:year [[st/integer :coerce str]]})

(st/validate {:year 1994} schema))
;; => [nil {:year "1994"}]
----

Looking at the data returned from the validation
process, one can see that the value is properly coerced with the specified coercion function.

This library comes with a collection of validators that already
have attached coercion functions. These serve to validate parameters
that arrive as strings but need to be converted to the appropriate type:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema {:year [st/required st/integer-str]
             :id [st/required st/uuid-str]})

(st/validate {:year "1994"
              :id "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}
             schema)
;; => [nil {:year 1994, :id #uuid "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}]
----

To facilitate this operation, the `validate!` function receives the
data and schema, then returns the resulting data. If data not matches the schema
an exception will be raised using `ex-info` clojure facility:

[source, clojure]
----
(st/validate! {:year "1994" :id "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"} schema)
;; => {:year 1994, :id #uuid "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}
----

=== Builtin Validators

This is the table with available builtin validators:

.Builtin Validators
[options="header", cols="2,1,4"]
|===========================================================================

| `struct.core/max-count`    | no       | Validator to check that value is not larger than a maximum number of characters.
|===========================================================================

Additional notes:

* `number-str` coerces to `java.lang.Double` or `float` (cljs)
* `boolean-str` coerces to `true` (`"t"`, `"true"`, `"1"`) or `false` (`"f"`, `"false"`, `"0"`).
* `string-str` coerces anything to string using `str` function.


=== Define your own validator

As mentioned previously, the validators in _struct_ library are defined using plain
hash-maps. For example, this is how the builtin `integer` validator is defined:

[source, clojure]
----
(def integer
  {:message "must be a integer"
   :optional true
   :validate integer?}))
----

If the validator needs access to previously validated data, the `:state` key
should be present with the value `true`. Let see the `identical-to` validator as example:

[source,clojure]
----
(def identical-to
  {:message "does not match"
   :optional true
   :state true
   :validate (fn [state v ref]
               (let [prev (get state ref)]
                 (= prev v)))})
----

Validators that access the state receive an additional argument with the state for validator
function.
